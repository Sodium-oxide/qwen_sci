RE_ANALYSIS_REPLAN_PROMPT = """
You are a meticulous research engineer specialized in iterative method design.

== Topic ==
{topic}

== Current mature idea (the method you must refine — do NOT change the topic) ==
{mature_idea}

== Refinement scope (optional; if empty, ignore) ==
{refinement_scope}

== Advanced analysis ==
{analysis}

== Ablation / experiment results (component-level evidence — THIS is your primary signal) ==
{ablation_results}

Your task:
Based on the ablation results, perform **minimal component-level targeted modifications** to the current mature idea.
- For each ablation entry, the "component" field names a specific module/loss/mechanism, "op" usually indicates "remove", "result" is "positive|negative|inconclusive", and "confidence" tells you how reliable the evidence is.
- If `op=remove` and `result=negative`, removing the component hurt; the component is likely critical, so keep or strengthen it.
- If `op=remove` and `result=positive`, removing the component helped; the component is likely harmful or redundant, so remove or replace it.
- If `result=inconclusive`, treat the evidence as weak and avoid overcommitting unless analysis strongly supports a change.
- This stage is a 1.0 -> 1.1 patch stage, NOT a 2.0 invention stage.
- Preserve the same topic, core hypothesis, and overall method axis.
- If you use `replace`, it must be a local substitute for the same functional slot, not a new architecture or new research paradigm.
- If refinement_scope is provided, treat it as a hard edit boundary. Keep all changes within that scope and do not move the repair to another subsystem.

Do NOT change the research topic. Instead, surgically revise the method design by:
1. Identifying which components to keep, strengthen, remove, or replace based on ablation evidence.
2. Proposing specific local replacement mechanisms or enhancements where needed (cite analysis insights).
3. Producing a revised mature_idea that stays very close to the current one and will serve as the MCTS root node.
