name: speculative-execution-with-repair
description: Introduce speculative or optimistic execution plus explicit repair so the system can pursue fast paths without giving up recoverability.

## defect_tags
- over_conservative_execution
- latency_bottleneck
- rollback_blindspot

## guardrails
- Define when speculation triggers and how mis-speculation is detected.
- Bound repair cost and rollback scope.
- Compare against a conservative baseline under matched experimental conditions.

## structural_mode
- path_branching

## scope_preference
- execution_path

## requires_control_centered_parent
- false

## atomic_blueprint
- ADD_COMPONENT(speculative_executor)
- ADD_COMPONENT(repair_handler)
- REWIRE(speculative_executor -> repair_handler)
- ADD_PROTOCOL(ablation,stress)

## required_protocols
- ablation
- stress

## avoid_combinations
- REMOVE_COMPONENT(repair_handler) in the same plan

## execution_logic
1. Identify the defect from `defect_tags`.
2. Generate the solution by **instantiating** the `atomic_blueprint`.
3. Format: `FUNCTION_NAME(ARGUMENTS) -> REASONING`
