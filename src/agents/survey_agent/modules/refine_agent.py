Your task is to plan a sequence of operations to review and revise the current section.

Available operations (skills):
1. "review": Analyze the section and provide scores and suggestions for improvement in three dimensions:
   - Readability (clarity, logical flow, formatting)
   - Depth (comprehensiveness, insightfulness, citation coverage)
   - Framework (alignment with section outline, structural coherence)
   
2. "revise": Apply specific revision suggestions to improve the section text.
   - Input: A single suggestion from the review
   - Output: Modified section text with the suggestion applied

3. "get_pseudocode": Retrieve pseudocode for a specific repository
   - Input: repo_name
   - Context to include: what specific aspect to focus on

4. "get_code_report": Include code report content in context
   - Input: specific code report or reference to include

5. "get_full_survey": Include the complete current survey content in context
   - Useful for cross-section coherence checking

6. "finish": Complete the revision for this section when satisfactory
   - CRITICAL: You can only call "finish" when ALL THREE review scores are >= 8:
     * Readability >= 8
     * Depth >= 8
     * Framework >= 8
   - If any score is below 8, you must continue to revise or gather more context first

[WORKFLOW - CRITICAL - FOLLOW THIS ORDER]
You MUST follow this workflow strictly:
1. First, if you have NOT yet reviewed the section, call "review" to analyze and get scores + suggestions
2. If you have already reviewed, you MUST use the EXISTING suggestions from memory to call "revise" - DO NOT call "review" again!
3. When all current suggestions are met, you may call "review" again if needed
4. Call "finish" ONLY when ALL THREE scores are >= 8, or when you have addressed all suggestions

[Priority Guidelines]
- Focus on the most impactful suggestions first
- Focus on the Memory content to learn the actions you have taken, and plan future actions with a reasonable workflow
- Prioritize suggestions that address the LOWEST-scoring dimensions
- Use external knowledge (keynotes, pseudocode) when the section needs more depth
- Ensure logical flow between sections using previous/next section context

# Section Review skill prompt
REVIEW_SKILL_PROMPT = """
You are an expert reviewer for an academic survey paper with deep analysis and insights concerning topic: {topic}. You are reviewing the section: {section_title}.

The draft section may contain inline paper citations in angle brackets (e.g., "<Attention is All You Need>").

### Task:
1. Read the Draft Text for the given section and perform a short, careful review focused on clarity, logical flow, technical accuracy, and depth for an academic survey.
2. Produce a clear, specific, and actionable **list of revision suggestion list**. 
3. Each suggestion should concisely explain *what* to change, *why* and *how* to implement it. When appropriate, point to the exact sentence or short excerpt from the draft to anchor the suggestion.
4. You will be provided with the previous and next sections for context. Use them to ensure logical flow and coherence across sections.
5. Only give suggestions on the current section. 
6. There are some basic requirements as follow. If the section does not meet any, provide relevant modification suggestions.
7. If the section is satisfactory, provide an empty suggestion list.
8. Suggest sorting by importance, with important ones coming first.
9. You are suggested to give no more than 5 suggestions

### Review Dimensions (Score 0-10 for each):

- **6-7**: Generally clear; reasonable flow; minor formatting issues; some sentences could be tightened
- **8-9**: Clear and well-structured; smooth logical flow; proper formatting; concise prose
- **10**: Exceptional clarity; publication-ready prose; elegant transitions between paragraphs

**Depth (0-10):**
- **0-3**: Superficial; mainly lists methods without analysis; few or irrelevant citations; no insights
- **4-5**: Basic coverage; limited analysis; citations present but not well-integrated; some generic statements
- **6-7**: Good coverage; some insightful analysis; citations support key points; identifies trends or patterns
- **8-9**: Comprehensive; deep analysis with novel perspectives; well-chosen citations; clear connections to field
- **10**: Outstanding depth; original insights that advance understanding; comprehensive and well-cited analysis

**Framework (0-10):**
- **0-3**: Misaligned with outline; incoherent structure; lacks academic rigor; terminology imprecise
- **4-5**: Partially follows outline; some structural issues; minor inconsistencies in terminology
- **6-7**: Follows outline reasonably; acceptable structure; consistent terminology; generally rigorous
- **8-9**: Well-aligned with outline; coherent structure; precise terminology; strong academic rigor
