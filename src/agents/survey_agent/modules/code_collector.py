MAIN_AND_CORE_FILTER = """
You are an assistant that classifies whether a file chunk is a *core implementation* for the main algorithm/architecture
of the repository of a paper titled {paper_title}. 

Context:

{paper_title}
{paper_abstract}

- repository structure:
{repo_structure}
- file_path: {file_path}
- file chunk:
{chunk_text}
(chunk end)

TASK 1: Classify Core Code
Rules for is_core:
- If the chunk contains core algorithm implementations, model definitions (class names like Model, Transformer, UNet, forward/ call methods),
  important data pipeline steps, or central algorithmic logic => is_core true.
- If it is helper utils, CI configs, docs, tests, or setup scripts => likely not core.

Scoring Standard for "score" (1-10):
[Score 1-2] Pure Boilerplate & Config (is_core: false)
Pure configurations, documentation, environment setup, CI/CD scripts, basic `argparse`, or trivial dependency management (e.g., requirements.txt, Dockerfiles, README, completely empty init files).
[Score 3-4] Generic Utilities & Helpers (is_core: false)
Generic software engineering tools that do not reflect the paper's algorithm. Examples: logging (Logger), checkpoint saving/loading, visualization/plotting scripts, standard file I/O, or standard metric calculations (e.g., generic Accuracy/MSE).
[Score 5-6] Standard Pipelines & Training Loops (is_core: false)
Standard Deep Learning skeletons. Examples: standard PyTorch/TensorFlow training loops (e.g., standard `for epoch in epochs`, basic optimizer steps), generic `Dataset`/`DataLoader` definitions, or standard text/image preprocessing. While necessary to run the code, they lack the paper's specific novelties.
[Score 7-8] Key Components & Novel Sub-modules (is_core: true)
Code implementing specific, secondary innovations from the paper. Examples: custom loss functions, novel data sampling/augmentation strategies, customized attention mechanisms, or specific sub-network blocks (e.g., a custom Adapter or ResBlock variation specifically proposed in the paper). 
[Score 9-10] Absolute Core & Main Algorithm (is_core: true)
The absolute "soul" of the paper. Main model class definitions (e.g., `class ProposedModel`), the complete `forward` or `call` methods that tie the novel architecture together, or direct code translations of the paper's primary mathematical equations and pseudocode. If this chunk is removed, the paper's main contribution ceases to exist.

TASK 2: Identify Main Entry Point Code (is_main_code)
This is a SEPARATE classification from is_core. Even if is_core is false, a file can be is_main_code if it contains:
- Functions that drive the main execution flow: main()
- Scripts that orchestrate the entire pipeline
- The skeleton of the pipeline

SCORING (main_score):
Assign a `main_score` from 0 to 10 indicating how central this file is to the overall execution flow:
- 9-10: Unambiguous top-level main entry point (orchestrates the entire pipeline).
- 7-8: High-level orchestrator for a major subsystem, but maybe not the top-most script.
- 0-6: Sub-modules, core algorithm implementations (without orchestration), utilities, data loaders, etc. (For these, is_main_code MUST be false).

IMPORTANT: 
is_main_code is about WHETHER THIS FILE IS AN ENTRY POINT that orchestrates the algorithm execution or is the skeleton script of the pipeline, NOT about whether it contains the core algorithm implementation.
I will use is_main_code True file to build the skeleton of the repository pseudocode. 

Output:
- Return EXACTLY a JSON object with keys for TASK 1 and TASK 2:
  - is_core: boolean
  - score: between 0 to 10 (core level)
  - reason: short string explanation for core classification (one or two sentences)

  - main_score: between 0 to 10 (main level)
  - main_reason: short string explanation for main code classification (one or two sentences)

TASK: Identify Main Entry Point Code (is_main_code) and Assign a Score
A file can be is_main_code if it contains:
- Functions that drive the main execution flow: main()
- Scripts that orchestrate the entire pipeline
- The skeleton of the pipeline

IMPORTANT STRICTNESS REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL):
You must be CAUTIOUS when setting `is_main_code` to true. 
is_main_code is about WHETHER THIS FILE IS AN ENTRY POINT that orchestrates the algorithm execution or is the skeleton script of the pipeline, NOT about whether it contains the core algorithm implementation.
I will concatenate ALL `is_main_code=True` files at once to build the SKELETON of the repository pseudocode. Too many files or including sub-modules/utilities will exceed the context window. 
- Only the absolute top-level entry points (the "conductor" of the orchestra, e.g., main.py, train.py) should be marked True.
- When in doubt, or if the file is just a module called by the main script, set `is_main_code` to false.
- Be cautious about marking the data-collect code and evaluation code as main code because sometimes they are unrelated to the core pipeline of repo.

SCORING (main_score):
Assign a `main_score` from 0 to 10 indicating how central this file is to the overall execution flow:
- 9-10: Unambiguous top-level main entry point (orchestrates the entire pipeline).
- 7-8: High-level orchestrator for a major subsystem, but maybe not the top-most script.

Output:
- Return EXACTLY a JSON object with the following keys:
  - is_main_code: boolean (Extremely strict! Only true for the absolute main skeleton/entry point)
  - main_score: integer (0-10, representing the confidence and centrality of the file)

- Use clear section divisions (e.g., for different phases like initialization, training, evaluation)
- The section number should be no more than 5.
- Do NOT include actual code - use algorithm-style pseudocode
- You are encourage to annotate file name (source code or called code) parsed by <> besides the corresponding pseudocode.
- You can also refine the analysis after pseudocode but must keep conciseness.
