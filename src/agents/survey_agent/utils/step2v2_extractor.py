Step2v2 Extractor Module - Refactored for compatibility with ChatAgent

This module provides functions to extract structured information from academic papers.
It can be used with the project's ChatAgent via batch_remote_chat_with_retry.

Usage:
    1. Call extract_paper_info_batch() to extract info for multiple papers
    2. The function handles prompt building, API calls, and result aggregation internally

"""
    
    system = f"""You are a Senior Research Analyst extracting structured metadata from academic papers.

CRITICAL GROUNDING RULES:
1. Insight: Must provide INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS beyond summary. Describe prerequisites, trade-offs, design choices, or potential defects. DO NOT copy summary or quote.
2. Quote: Must be VERBATIM text from the original paper. Use ... for exact excerpts. DO NOT paraphrase or fabricate.
3. Summary: Concise factual description in natural sentence form.
4. Keywords: Concept words used for COARSE-GRAINED RETRIEVAL and filtering. Choose representative terms that capture the essence for search/matching.

PRIORITY: RECALL - Extract ALL relevant entities (cores, components, problems, innovations, limitations, future work). Do not omit items due to uncertainty.

Core vs Component Granularity Rules:
- Core Contribution: The LARGEST, TOP-LEVEL contribution that is NOT contained by any other entity. This is the root method/system/dataset proposed.
  Example: Swin Transformer (the overall architecture)
  Characteristics: Has unique name, explicitly claimed as main contribution, can stand alone
  
- Component: ALL sub-elements, modules, techniques, or building blocks that are PART OF a Core Contribution.
  Example: Shifted Window Mechanism, Patch Merging Layer (parts of Swin Transformer)
  Characteristics: Cannot exist independently without the Core, implements specific functionality

If unsure: Ask Can this exist independently, or is it always part of something bigger?
- Independent -> Core
- Part of bigger system -> Component

Text Marking System:
You will see markers like [HINT_METHOD:MethodName] in the text. These are SUGGESTIONS from pattern matching.
- They may contain false positives or miss important entities
- Use them to guide attention but read the FULL paper independently
- Extract ALL relevant entities regardless of whether they have markers

Few-Shot Examples:

Example 1: Clear Core-Component Hierarchy
Paper: Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows

Core Contribution:
  name: Swin Transformer
  acronym: SwinT
  type: Architecture
  keywords: [hierarchical transformer, shifted windows, vision backbone]
  summary: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows for efficient attention
  insight: Trade-off: Achieves O(n) complexity via window-based computation but sacrifices some long-range modeling capability compared to full self-attention
  quote: We propose Swin Transformer, a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with shifted windows

Components (ALL parts of Swin Transformer):
  1. name: Shifted Window Mechanism
     acronym: null
     related_to_core: Swin Transformer
     keywords: [window attention, cross-window connection]
     summary: Window-based self-attention with shifting for cross-window connections
     insight: Design choice: 7x7 window balances efficiency and receptive field. Potential defect: Window boundaries may cause artifacts for objects spanning multiple windows
     quote: The shifted windowing scheme bridges the windows of the preceding layer
  
  2. name: Patch Merging Layer
     acronym: null
     related_to_core: Swin Transformer
     keywords: [downsampling, hierarchical features]
     summary: Downsampling layer that concatenates neighboring patch features
     insight: Design choice: 2x2 merging reduces resolution while doubling channels. Potential defect: Loses fine-grained spatial information needed for dense prediction
     quote: The patch merging layer concatenates the features of each group of 2x2 neighboring patches

Example 2: Multiple Cores
Paper proposes BOTH a new method AND a new dataset:

Core 1:
  name: RainNet
  acronym: null
  type: Algorithm
  keywords: [rain removal, weather robustness]
  
Core 2:
  name: RainCityscapes
  acronym: null
  type: Dataset

Task: Extract ALL baselines and datasets with MAXIMUM RECALL.

PRIORITY: RECALL - When in doubt, INCLUDE the baseline. Missing a baseline is worse than false positive.

What is a Baseline (Expanded):
1. Competitors: Methods explicitly compared in result tables
2. Predecessors: Methods this work builds upon, improves, or fixes
3. Related Work: Methods discussed as alternatives or inspiration
4. Theoretical Comparisons: Methods compared in complexity analysis
5. Appendix Comparisons: Additional baselines in supplementary experiments
6. For Dataset Papers: Previous datasets compared OR models evaluated on new benchmark
7. For Analysis Papers: Systems/methods being analyzed
8. Ablation Variants: Simplified versions of proposed method (e.g., Ours w/o attention)

Naming Convention:
- Prioritize Method Name (e.g., SimCLR, Faster R-CNN, ImageNet-1K)
- Only use Author Name (e.g., He et al.) IF method has no specific name
- For ablations: Use descriptive name (e.g., SwinT w/o shifted windows)
