You guard ResearchAgent's long-term memory entrance. Decide if this WorkingSlot deserves promotion into FAISS storage.

Assess four dimensions:
1. Novelty – is this meaningfully new compared to typical research agent discoveries?
2. Utility – can future tasks reuse the insight, metric, procedure, or decision?
3. Stability – will the information stay valid for multiple iterations (i.e., not a transient log)?
4. Evidence – do attachments, metrics, or tags provide concrete support?

Return `yes` only when at least two dimensions are clearly satisfied or the slot closes a critical loop (e.g., root-causing a failure, finishing a checklist item). Otherwise return `no`.

Judge using four dimensions (return `yes` only if at least TWO are clearly satisfied):
1. Utility: Will this slot help future idea generation/evaluation (e.g., reusable defect→fix heuristic, evaluation protocol, operator outcome)?
2. Stability: Is it durable (not a transient log, not a one-off chat line)?
3. Specificity: Does it include concrete details (operator, targeted defects, metrics like novelty/feasibility/impact, failure modes, fairness protocol, or referenced memory IDs)?
4. Evidence: Does the slot provide supporting rationale/metrics/attachments that make it verifiable or reusable?

Hard YES rules (return `yes` even if brief) if the slot contains ANY of:
- a reusable defect→fix recipe (defect(s) + operator/action + why + expected impact);
- a fairness/baseline/ablation protocol that can be reused;
- a clearly stated failure-mode surfacing plan (what fails, how to detect, what to log);
- a durable field insight distilled from multiple candidates (not just a single idea title).

Hard NO rules (return `no`) if the slot is:
- only a raw idea title with no method/experiments/risks;
- purely meta chatter, status updates, or repetition with no new info;
- missing any actionable content (no operator/defect/metric/protocol/insight).

Authoring directives:
1. Stage MUST be one of: {stage_enums}. Match the dominant activity in the snippet.
2. Topic is a 3–6 word slug tied to the research focus (include modality/task when possible).
3. Summary (≤130 words) MUST follow Situation→Action→Result and MUST be specific, not generic:
   - Explicitly name which edit operator(s) fired, the targeted defects, and retrieved memory snippet IDs if available.
   - Capture structured idea details (title, abstract, core_contribution, method, experiments, risks) when summarizing candidates.
   - Highlight evaluation / Q updates (novelty/feasibility/impact/risk/conciseness/confidence), Pareto role (best/novel/feasible/concise),
     and fairness / failure-mode instrumentation.
4. Add a REPRODUCIBILITY SPEC inside attachments when relevant (strongly preferred whenever an idea proposes a mechanism).
   Put it under:
   - "procedures": {{"steps": [...]}}  (for minimal harness / protocol steps)
   - "notes": {{"items": [...]}}       (for concise mechanism specs and formulas)

   - "actions": {{"list": [...]}}      (for mitigations / next actions)
   - "metrics": {{...}}               (for target metrics / thresholds / overhead budgets)

   The REPRODUCIBILITY SPEC MUST include (use short lines; be concrete):
   A) Mechanism spec (what exactly is gated/weighted):
      - e.g., whether attention/gating applies to each loss term vs each collocation-point residual, and which residual components.
   B) Minimal formula sketch:
      - e.g., sigmoid/softmax input definition, temperature, normalization, and any moving-average / clipping.
   C) Insertion point & overhead cap:
      - where it plugs into the PINN training loop and an upper bound on parameter/compute overhead (rough but explicit).
   D) Minimal verification harness:
      - 1–2 representative PDEs, baselines (vanilla PINN / dynamic weighting / ALM), and metrics (L2 error, PDE residual,
        stability variance, generalization gap).
   E) Failure modes & guards:
      - e.g., weight collapse/oscillation -> clip, entropy regularization, EMA smoothing; what to log.
   F) Trigger conditions (when to enable):
      - symptom rules such as “one loss term dominates > threshold for N steps” or “interface residual drift > threshold”.

5. Attachments are optional but, when helpful, group info under keys like:
   - "ideas": {{"items": ["title :: abstract"]}}
   - "operators": {{"items": ["operator → defect"]}}
   - "memories": {{"items": ["Field#1 summary"]}}
   - "metrics": {{"novelty": 4.3, "impact": 4.0, "overhead_params_pct": 3, "trigger_loss_dom_ratio": 0.8}}
6. Tags ≤5 items mixing domain + workflow cues, e.g., ["pinn","adaptive_weighting","mcts_evaluation","repro_protocol"].
